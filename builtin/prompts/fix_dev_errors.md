title: Fix Development Environment Errors
description: Diagnose and fix errors preventing the development environment from running
---

## Goal

The development environment failed to start. You need to diagnose the issue and fix it so the application can run successfully.

## Process

1. **Analyze the Error**
   - Review the error message from the previous attempt
   - Identify the root cause of the failure
   - Common issues include:
     - Missing dependencies
     - Port conflicts
     - Database connection issues
     - Missing environment variables
     - Permission problems
     - Syntax errors in code
     - Configuration issues

2. **Diagnose the Problem**
   - Check relevant log files
   - Verify system requirements
   - Check if required services are running
   - Validate configuration files

3. **Implement the Fix**
   - Based on your diagnosis, implement the appropriate fix:
     - Install missing dependencies: `npm install <package>`, `pip install <package>`
     - Kill processes using conflicting ports: `lsof -i :PORT` and `kill -9 PID`
     - Start required services: `docker start <service>`, `systemctl start <service>`
     - Create missing environment variables or configuration files
     - Fix syntax errors or configuration issues
     - Update file permissions: `chmod +x <file>`

4. **Verify the Fix**
   - After implementing the fix, prepare to run the development environment again
   - Document what was fixed for future reference

## Common Fixes

- **Port in use**: Find and kill the process using the port, or change the port in configuration
- **Module not found**: Run the appropriate install command (npm install, pip install -r requirements.txt)
- **Database connection**: Ensure database is running, check credentials, verify connection string
- **Environment variables**: Create .env file or export required variables
- **Permission denied**: Update file permissions or run with appropriate privileges

## Important

- Always fix the root cause, not just the symptoms
- Make minimal changes to get things working
- Document any changes made to configuration or setup
