# Step 6: Final Validation and Documentation

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/sah/ideas/test.md

## Objective
Perform comprehensive validation of the new `sah test` command and ensure all functionality works as expected.

## Task Details

### Comprehensive Testing
1. **Manual Command Testing**
   ```bash
   # Command recognition
   sah --help | grep test
   
   # Command help  
   sah test --help
   
   # Basic execution (in test environment)
   sah test
   ```

2. **Automated Test Validation**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests to ensure no regressions
   cargo test
   
   # Run specific test command tests
   cargo test test_command
   
   # Run with nextest for performance
   cargo nextest run --fail-fast
   ```

3. **Workflow Integration Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test workflow listing
   sah flow list | grep -i test
   
   # Direct workflow execution
   sah flow run test
   ```

### Code Quality Validation
1. **Build and Lint Checks**
   ```bash
   # Clean build
   cargo build
   
   # Format check
   cargo fmt --all -- --check
   
   # Lint validation  
   cargo clippy
   ```

2. **Integration Verification**
   - All imports resolve correctly
   - No compilation warnings
   - Command appears in help text
   - Workflow executes without immediate errors

### Documentation Updates
1. **Command Help Text**
   - Verify `description.md` provides clear usage
   - Update if needed for clarity

2. **Integration Validation**
   - Command follows established patterns
   - Consistent with other top-level commands
   - Error handling matches project standards

## Success Criteria Validation

### ✅ Command Availability
- [ ] `sah test --help` shows appropriate help
- [ ] `sah --help` lists test command
- [ ] Command is recognized by CLI parser

### ✅ Workflow Execution  
- [ ] `sah test` successfully initiates TDD workflow
- [ ] Workflow states and actions execute correctly
- [ ] Error handling works as expected

### ✅ Integration Quality
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Tests pass consistently 
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] CLI integration is seamless

### ✅ Testing Coverage
- [ ] Integration tests validate command functionality
- [ ] Tests use proper isolation patterns
- [ ] Error conditions are tested
- [ ] No flaky test behaviors

## Final Deliverables
1. **Working `sah test` command** that executes TDD workflow
2. **Comprehensive test suite** with proper isolation
3. **Clean code** that passes all quality checks
4. **Documentation** that explains command usage

## Validation Commands
```bash
# Complete validation sequence
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy  
cargo test
cargo build
sah test --help
```

## Size Estimate
~30 lines of validation scripts and documentation updates

## Dependencies
- All previous steps (1-5) must be completed successfully
- All tests must pass before this step is considered complete
