# Document Metrics Categories and Data Structures

## Overview

Populate the document with comprehensive details about all metrics categories, their data structures, and purposes.

## Requirements

### Metrics Categories to Document

**RunMetrics**
- Document all fields and their purposes
- Explain timing and duration measurements
- Detail state execution tracking
- Memory usage monitoring approach
- Error tracking mechanisms

**WorkflowSummaryMetrics**  
- Aggregated statistics explanation
- Success/failure rate calculation
- Performance averages methodology
- Hot state analysis approach
- Historical trend tracking

**GlobalMetrics**
- System-wide statistics overview
- Overall success rate calculation
- Total execution time tracking
- Active workflow count monitoring
- Resource usage trend analysis

**MemoryMetrics**
- Peak memory usage tracking methodology
- Initial vs final memory state comparison
- Context variable count tracking
- History size monitoring approach

**ResourceTrends**
- Time-series data collection approach
- Memory usage over time tracking
- CPU usage pattern analysis
- Throughput analysis (runs per hour)
- Data point management strategy

### Documentation Format

**For Each Category**
- Clear purpose explanation
- Complete field listing with descriptions
- Usage context and triggers
- Relationships to other metric types
- Code examples from actual implementation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All five metrics categories fully documented
- [ ] Every data field explained with purpose
- [ ] Code examples included for each category
- [ ] Relationships between categories explained
- [ ] Usage contexts clearly described
- [ ] Field types and constraints documented

## Implementation Notes

Use the codebase analysis to ensure accuracy. Include actual field names, types, and purposes from the implementation. Reference specific locations in the source code for each metric type.
