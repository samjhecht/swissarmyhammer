# Document Performance Characteristics and Built-in Limits

## Overview

Document the performance characteristics, built-in limits, and scalability features of the metrics collection system.

## Requirements

### Built-in Limits Documentation

**System Constants**
- MAX_TREND_DATA_POINTS: 100 - purpose and impact
- MAX_RUN_METRICS: 1000 - storage limits and behavior
- MAX_WORKFLOW_METRICS: 100 - aggregation constraints
- MAX_STATE_DURATIONS_PER_RUN: 50 - state tracking limits
- Other configurable limits and thresholds

**Cleanup Mechanisms**
- Automatic old data removal processes
- Configurable retention periods and policies
- Memory bounds enforcement strategies
- Aging policies for historical data
- Storage optimization techniques

### Scalability Analysis

**Performance Characteristics**
- Memory usage patterns during collection
- CPU overhead of metrics collection
- Storage growth rates over time
- Impact on workflow execution performance
- Concurrent access handling

**Resource Management**
- Memory allocation strategies
- Data structure efficiency (HashMap usage)
- Cleanup trigger conditions
- Performance under high load
- System resource protection

### Optimization Features

**Data Structure Efficiency**
- HashMap-based storage for fast lookup
- ULID-based unique identifier benefits
- Timestamp-based chronological tracking
- Serialization performance characteristics
- Memory locality optimizations
