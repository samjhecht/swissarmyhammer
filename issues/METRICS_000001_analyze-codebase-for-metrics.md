# Analyze Codebase for Workflow Metrics Collection

## Overview

Perform a thorough analysis of the codebase to identify all locations where workflow metrics are collected, stored, and processed.

## Requirements

### Analysis Scope

**Primary Source Files**
- `swissarmyhammer/src/workflow/metrics.rs` - Core metrics implementation
- `swissarmyhammer/src/workflow/executor/core.rs` - Executor integration points
- `swissarmyhammer/src/workflow/run.rs` - Run tracking and status
- `swissarmyhammer/src/workflow/metrics_tests.rs` - Test coverage patterns

**Secondary Investigation**
- Search for "metrics" usage across the entire codebase
- Identify metric collection trigger points
- Document data flow patterns
- Review storage and retrieval mechanisms

### Deliverables

**Metrics Categories Inventory**
- List all metric types (RunMetrics, WorkflowSummaryMetrics, etc.)
- Document data fields for each type
- Note collection frequency and triggers
- Identify performance limits and constraints

**Integration Point Mapping**
- Where metrics are initialized
- When data is collected during workflow execution
- How metrics are aggregated and processed
- Storage and cleanup mechanisms

**Code Examples Collection**
- Key usage patterns from source code
- Integration examples from executor
- Test patterns demonstrating functionality
- Error handling and edge cases

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete inventory of all metrics types and fields
- [ ] Documentation of all collection points in workflow execution
- [ ] Code examples extracted for key patterns
- [ ] Performance characteristics identified (limits, cleanup)
- [ ] Integration patterns with WorkflowExecutor mapped
- [ ] Test coverage patterns documented

## Implementation Notes

Use semantic search and code analysis tools to ensure comprehensive coverage. Focus on understanding the complete metrics lifecycle from collection to cleanup.

This analysis forms the foundation for creating the comprehensive metrics summary document.
