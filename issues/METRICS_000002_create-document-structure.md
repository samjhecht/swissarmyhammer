# Create Document Structure and Outline

## Overview

Create the skeleton structure for the workflow metrics summary document with all required sections and placeholders.

## Requirements

### Document Location
Create `WORKFLOW_METRICS_SUMMARY.md` at project root with complete structure.

### Section Structure

**Required Sections**
- Executive Summary (placeholder)
- Metrics Categories (with subsection stubs)
- Data Collection Points (placeholder)
- Performance and Scalability (with limit constants)
- Integration Points (placeholder)
- Usage Examples (placeholder sections)
- Future Considerations (placeholder)

**Navigation Elements**
- Table of contents with section links
- Code block placeholders for examples
- Mermaid diagram placeholder for system overview

### Format Requirements

**Markdown Standards**
- Consistent heading hierarchy
- Placeholder text indicating content to be filled
- Code block formatting prepared
- Link structure for source file references

**Documentation Style**
- Follow existing project documentation patterns
- Include section descriptions
- Prepare example code formatting
- Structure for mermaid diagrams

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Document file created at correct location
- [ ] All required sections present with proper hierarchy
- [ ] Table of contents with working links
- [ ] Placeholder content clearly marked
- [ ] Code block structures prepared
- [ ] Mermaid diagram placeholders included
- [ ] Consistent formatting throughout

## Implementation Notes

This creates the framework that will be populated with the analysis findings. Focus on structure and navigation rather than content at this stage.

The document should be ready to receive detailed content while maintaining professional formatting and organization.
