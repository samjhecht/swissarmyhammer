# CLI UX Improvement: UI Foundation Module and Theme System

## Overview

Create the foundational UI module structure and implement a theme system that will support the modern, beautiful CLI experience described in the specification. This establishes the base architecture for all future UI components.

## Goals

1. Create a well-organized UI module structure
2. Implement a flexible theme system with light/dark modes
3. Define semantic color schemes for consistent visual language
4. Establish styling primitives for UI components
5. Create theme configuration and persistence

## Technical Design

### Module Structure

```
swissarmyhammer-cli/src/ui/
├── mod.rs           # Module root with public API
├── theme.rs         # Theme system and color definitions
├── style.rs         # Styling primitives and helpers
├── config.rs        # UI configuration and preferences
└── utils.rs         # Common UI utilities
```

### Implementation Steps

1. Create the `ui` module directory structure
2. Implement the `Color` and `ColorPalette` types with RGB support
3. Create the `Theme` struct with predefined light and dark themes
4. Implement the `Style` API for applying colors and text styles
5. Create the `UiConfig` system for persistence
6. Build the `UiContext` manager for theme selection
7. Add terminal dark mode detection
8. Implement emoji/icon support with fallbacks
9. Add unit tests for theme system
10. Create integration with existing CLI code

## Success Criteria

- [x] UI module structure created and organized
- [x] Theme system supports light and dark themes
- [x] Semantic color system implemented
- [x] Styling API provides consistent interface
- [x] Configuration persists user preferences
- [x] Terminal detection works correctly
- [x] Emoji support with text fallbacks
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] No performance regression
- [x] Documentation complete

## Proposed Solution

I will implement the UI foundation module for SwissArmyHammer CLI following these steps:

1. **Module Structure**: Create a modular architecture under `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/ui/` with separate files for themes, styles, configuration, and utilities.

2. **Type System**: Define strong types for colors, themes, and styles that leverage Rust's type system to prevent errors and provide clear APIs.

3. **Color System**: Implement a flexible color system that:
   - Supports RGB colors with conversion to terminal colors
   - Provides semantic color names (primary, secondary, success, error, warning, info)
   - Integrates with the existing `colored` crate for terminal output
   - Supports both 16-color and 256-color terminals

4. **Theme Architecture**: Create a theme system that:
   - Defines light and dark themes with carefully chosen color palettes
   - Supports custom themes through configuration
   - Provides a `ThemeProvider` trait for extensibility
   - Includes semantic styling (headers, emphasis, muted text, etc.)

5. **Style API**: Build a fluent style API that:
   - Allows chaining of style properties
   - Provides consistent methods across the codebase
   - Wraps the `colored` crate to add our semantic layer
   - Supports text decorations (bold, italic, underline, etc.)

6. **Configuration**: Implement persistent configuration that:
   - Stores user theme preferences in `~/.swissarmyhammer/ui.yaml`
   - Supports environment variable overrides (`SAH_THEME`)
   - Provides sensible defaults
   - Validates configuration on load

7. **Terminal Detection**: Add smart terminal detection that:
   - Detects terminal dark/light mode preferences
   - Falls back gracefully on unsupported terminals
   - Respects NO_COLOR and FORCE_COLOR environment variables
   - Uses `is_terminal::IsTerminal` for TTY detection

8. **Icon System**: Create an icon/emoji system that:
   - Provides semantic icons (success ✓, error ✗, warning ⚠, info ℹ)
   - Automatically falls back to ASCII on non-Unicode terminals
   - Supports custom icon sets through themes
   - Respects user preferences for emoji usage

9. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive tests including:
   - Unit tests for color conversions and theme logic
   - Integration tests for terminal output
   - Snapshot tests for styled output
   - Performance benchmarks for style application

10. **Integration**: Carefully integrate with existing code by:
    - Creating adapter functions for current color usage
    - Providing migration path for existing colored calls
    - Ensuring backward compatibility in output format
    - Adding UI context to CLI application state

This approach ensures we build a solid foundation that is extensible, performant, and provides a great developer experience while maintaining the existing CLI functionality.
