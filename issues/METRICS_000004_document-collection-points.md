# Document Data Collection Points and Integration

## Overview

Document where and how metrics are collected throughout the workflow execution lifecycle.

## Requirements

### Collection Point Mapping

**Workflow Lifecycle Integration**
- Workflow execution start triggers
- State transition monitoring
- State execution completion tracking
- Run completion and finalization
- Error condition capture points

**WorkflowExecutor Integration**
- Metrics initialization on workflow start
- State execution time recording methodology
- Memory metrics update triggers
- Run completion tracking process
- Context variable monitoring

**Trigger Points Documentation**
- When each metric type is collected
- Frequency of data collection
- Automatic vs manual collection triggers
- Performance impact of collection
- Data validation at collection time

### Integration Architecture

**System Flow Diagram**
- Create mermaid diagram showing data flow
- Collection points in execution lifecycle
- Storage and aggregation processes
- Cleanup and maintenance operations

**Code Integration Points**
- Specific functions that collect metrics
- Integration with WorkflowExecutor methods
- Error handling during collection
- Thread safety considerations

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All collection points identified and documented
- [ ] Integration with WorkflowExecutor fully explained
- [ ] System flow diagram created with mermaid
- [ ] Collection triggers and frequency documented
- [ ] Performance impact of collection assessed
- [ ] Error handling during collection explained
- [ ] Thread safety considerations addressed

## Implementation Notes

Focus on the practical aspects of how metrics are collected during actual workflow execution. Include specific method names and integration points from the codebase analysis.
